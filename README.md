# Christmas Tweet Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes Christmas-related tweets sourced from Kaggle to evaluate the moods of different countries during the holiday season. So far I have been able to extract tweets, hastags, languages, and emojis from the metadata. I am currently working on finding a solution to determine the moods set by the tweets and emojis.
